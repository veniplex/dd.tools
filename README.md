A modern, offline-first, and privacy-focused suite of tools for Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition), built for Dungeon Masters and Players who value speed, reliability, and data ownership.

## ✨ Core Philosophy

- **Privacy First**: All your data stays on your device. We use IndexedDB for local storage; no cloud sync, no tracking, no account required.
- **Offline Capable**: Built as a PWA (Progressive Web App). Once loaded, it works anywhere—even in the deepest dungeons without Wi-Fi.
- **Modern Tech**: Leveraging the latest Svelte 5 "Runes" for a snappy, reactive user experience.

## 🛠️ Included Tools

### Encounter Tracker

A robust combat management tool designed to streamline initiative and HP tracking.

- **Dynamic Initiative**: Sort units by roll, bonus, or manual tie-breakers.
- **Health Management**: Inline editing for HP, Max HP, and Temporary HP with visual health bars.
- **Encounter Groups**: Organize your prep with custom groups and drag-and-drop organization.
